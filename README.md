# Fire Note

The core goal of Fire Note is to allow Firefighters to log and recall notes that related to fighting fires or related activities. Though this app will never or should replace paper and pen as technology will never be 100% fall proof, it will provide a useful tool to aid with recording of notes and activities.

I don't know about you, for me, I can write some important notes down on paper and come back couple of later thinking some kind of drunk stole wrote on my pad, only to find it was me :).

The key features of Fire Note:

1. Record activities related to a fire scene.
2. Works completely offline, no internet is required 
3. Real time 6 Grid reference shown with current heading and resection support to aid with finding current location.
4. If online, nearest address will be shown based on current location
5. Current location, heading, direction and last known address recorded
